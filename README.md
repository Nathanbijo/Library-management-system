# Library Management System (12th Grade Final Project)

A simple, menu-driven **Library Management System** built with **Python** and **MySQL**.  
Manage **books, members, lendings/returns, fines, staff, and spending** through a terminal interface.

**Repo contents**
- `source.py` — Python program (menu-driven CLI)
- `server.sql` — MySQL schema + sample data

---

## 🧰 Requirements
- **Python** 3.8+
- **MySQL** 8.x (or MariaDB)
- Python package: `mysql-connector-python`

Install the Python connector:
```bash
pip install mysql-connector-python
🗃️ Database Setup (MySQL)

Start MySQL and log in:

mysql -u root -p


Create the database exactly with this name (lowercase, includes spaces):

CREATE DATABASE `library management system`;


Important

The code expects the database name library management system.

On Linux/macOS, names can be case-sensitive—use the exact spelling.

If server.sql has a DROP DATABASE line, remove/comment it before importing.

Load tables + sample data (from your OS shell, not inside the MySQL prompt):

mysql -u root -p "library management system" < server.sql


(Or, inside MySQL: USE \library management system`;then paste the CREATE/INSERT parts fromserver.sql`.)

🔌 Default Connection Details

The program (in source.py) connects using:

host: localhost

user: root

password: Mysql@2005

database: library management system

If your local MySQL password differs, update it in source.py or change your local root password accordingly.

▶️ Running the Program

From the folder containing source.py:

python source.py


Login options (demo IDs)

Librarian (trial): 123456

Manager (trial): 1234567
(If you’ve added staff via SQL with passwords, use their ID No + password.)

✨ Features (Menu Overview)

Books

Add / remove books

Search by name / id / writer / category

List all books; filter available vs borrowed

Members & Memberships

Add members (Reg ID, Name, Mobile No., Tenure)

View member details

Renew membership (annual tenures)

Lendings & Returns

Lend a book to a member

Extend “Borrowed Till” (total cap: 30 days)

Return book; availability status updates automatically

Fines

Automatic fine by days delayed:

0 days → ₹0

1–2 days → ₹10/day

3–5 days → ₹20 + ₹25/day over 2

≥6 days → ₹95 + ₹50/day over 5

Staff

Add staff (ID No like LIBXXXX), set position & salary

Passwords for privileged roles (e.g., Manager)

View / edit staff details

Spending

Record purchases (item, date, amount)

Filter by item & date range

Show totals over a period

🧪 Quick Demo Flow

python source.py

Login as Manager (trial): 1234567

Try: add a Member → lend a Book → extend/return → check Fines

Record a Spending entry and view totals

🐞 Troubleshooting

“Error! Not connected to MySQL”
Ensure MySQL is running, credentials in source.py are correct, and DB name is library management system.

Login fails
Use trial IDs above or add staff via SQL and use their ID No + password.

Import drops my DB
Remove/comment any DROP DATABASE in server.sql before importing.

Case sensitivity
On Linux/macOS, create the DB exactly as: `library management system` (lowercase, with spaces).

📄 Notes

This project is intentionally kept in its original classic terminal form as built for a 12th-grade final.
Optional future improvements: parameterized queries, .env for credentials, unit tests for fine logic, and a minimal web UI.
